/*FizzBuzz

Brent is extremely particular about his outfits. Starting with the 1st day
of summer, he wears a yellow shirt every 3rd day and a pink shirt every
7th day. On conflicting days (i.e. days that are multiples of both 3 and 7),
he opts for his favorite blue tank instead.

1) Ask the user to input the day of summer as an integer, and store it in a
variable. Use a conditional to test for the various repsonses they could give,
and alert what Brent will be wearing that day. Keep in mind a user may not
input a number, and make sure your code is able to handle that with an
appropriate response!


2) Use a loop to calculate the number of times each summer Brent will wear
his yellow shirt, pink shirt, and blue tank. Store each in a variable and
alert them.
